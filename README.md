# FinalProject
Adventure RPG Questionnaire 
Michael Fontes

This game is a RPG adventure, with a battle system, a questionnaire, and a scoring system. The goal is for the player to reach the end of their adventure by going through 10 quests that are set up as questionnaires. In between each quest, the player will encounter enemies that the player chooses to attack or run away. 
the catch of all of this is that the player has lives, or in this case, crewmates. The crewmates are basically players lives. The players starts with 4 crewmates. Crewmates are lost if the player answeres the quest-ions wrong. If player loses all crewmates, it is game over. Another way the player can lose is in the battle system. The player has 10 HP or health. If player HP is 0, game over.
Player is awarded money when defeating enemies and in turn, can be used in towns. Player can restore health or buy new crewmates(lives) with the money they earned when they are in towns. Towns won't happen often in game, adding difficulty.
